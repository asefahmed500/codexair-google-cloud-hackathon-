/**
 * @fileOverview A Genkit tool to fetch details for a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID.
 * This tool currently returns mocked data. In a real implementation for canonical CWE details,
 * it would ideally query a comprehensive CWE database (like MITRE's official data).
 * The NVD API (GET /rest/json/cves/2.0) is primarily for CVEs (specific vulnerability instances)
 * and can be queried by CWE to find related CVEs, but doesn't directly serve canonical CWE names/descriptions.
 *
 * - fetchCveDetailsTool - The Genkit tool definition.
 * - CveDetailsInput - Input schema for the tool.
 * - CveDetailsOutput - Output schema for the tool.
