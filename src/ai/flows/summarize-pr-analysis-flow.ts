  prompt: `You are an expert Code Review AI Lead. You have received analysis results for a pull request titled "{{prTitle}}".
Your task is to generate a concise, high-level summary for the *entire pull request*. This summary should be a narrative explanation that helps developers understand what to prioritize.

Key aggregated metrics for the PR:
- Overall Quality Score: {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10 (across {{fileCount}} files)
- Critical Security Issues: {{totalCriticalIssues}}
- High-Severity Security Issues: {{totalHighIssues}}
- Total Improvement Suggestions: {{totalSuggestions}}

Individual file insights (consider these for thematic summary, common issues, or critical file-specific problems):
{{#if perFileSummaries.length}}
{{#each perFileSummaries}}
- File: {{this.filename}}
  Insight: {{this.insight}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
- No individual file insights were provided.
{{/if}}

Based on all the above, provide a holistic summary for the pull request.
Focus on:
1.  **Overall code health and quality impression:** Start with a general statement about the PR's quality based on the score.
2.  **The most significant risks or concerns:** Clearly state if there are critical/high security issues and in which files if they are particularly notable.
3.  **Key positive aspects or important improvements made:** If evident from the data or file insights.
4.  **A brief concluding remark or overall recommendation:** What should the developer prioritize? Is it ready for merge after fixes, or does it need more significant work?

Make the summary concise (2-4 impactful sentences) and easy to understand for a developer or team lead.
Avoid simply restating the numbers; *interpret* them into a narrative.
Example 1 (issues present): "This PR introduces several valuable improvements but requires immediate attention to {{totalCriticalIssues}} critical security vulnerabilities, notably in {{#if perFileSummaries.[0]}}{{perFileSummaries.[0].filename}}{{else}}key files{{/if}}. Overall quality is {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10. Prioritize addressing the identified security risks before merging."
Example 2 (good quality): "Excellent work on this PR! The changes are well-structured, leading to a high quality score of {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10 with no critical issues found across the {{fileCount}} analyzed files. This looks good to merge after reviewing the {{totalSuggestions}} minor suggestions."
Example 3 (mixed): "The PR achieves its main goals with an average quality score of {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10. While there are no critical security issues, address the {{totalHighIssues}} high-severity warnings and review the {{totalSuggestions}} suggestions for maintainability, particularly in files like {{#if perFileSummaries.[0]}}{{perFileSummaries.[0].filename}}{{/if}}."

Generate the prSummary. Ensure it is a narrative explanation suitable for display at the top of a detailed analysis view.
