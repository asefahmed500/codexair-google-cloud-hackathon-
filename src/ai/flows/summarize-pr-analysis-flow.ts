Based on all the above, provide a holistic summary for the pull request/scan.
Focus on:
1.  **Overall code health and quality impression:** Start with a general statement about the quality based on the score.
2.  **The most significant risks or concerns:** Clearly state if there are critical/high security issues and in which files if they are particularly notable.
3.  **Key positive aspects or important improvements made:** If evident from the data or file insights.
4.  **A brief concluding remark or overall recommendation:** What should the developer prioritize? Is it ready for merge after fixes, or does it need more significant work?

Make the summary concise (2-4 impactful sentences) and easy to understand for a developer or team lead.
Avoid simply restating the numbers; *interpret* them into a narrative.
Example 1 (issues present): "This PR introduces several valuable improvements but requires immediate attention to {{totalCriticalIssues}} critical security vulnerabilities, notably in {{#if perFileSummaries.[0]}}{{perFileSummaries.[0].filename}}{{else}}key files{{/if}}. Overall quality is {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10. Prioritize addressing the identified security risks before merging."
Example 2 (good quality): "Excellent work on this PR! The changes are well-structured, leading to a high quality score of {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10 with no critical issues found across the {{fileCount}} analyzed files. This looks good to merge after reviewing the {{totalSuggestions}} minor suggestions."
Example 3 (mixed): "The PR achieves its main goals with an average quality score of {{formattedOverallQualityScore}}/10. While there are no critical security issues, address the {{totalHighIssues}} high-severity warnings and review the {{totalSuggestions}} suggestions for maintainability, particularly in files like {{#if perFileSummaries.[0]}}{{perFileSummaries.[0].filename}}{{/if}}."

Generate the prSummary. Ensure it is a narrative explanation suitable for display at the top of a detailed analysis view.

const TLDR_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS = `
Generate a "TL;DR" (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary.
Respond with ONLY up to 3 bullet points highlighting the most critical issues or key positive takeaways.
Each bullet point should be concise and impactful.
If critical/high security issues exist, prioritize those.
If no critical/high issues, mention overall quality and any significant suggestions.
If no major issues or outstanding points, state "No major critical issues or key takeaways identified."

Example TL;DR:
- Addresses 2 critical XSS vulnerabilities in payment.js.
- Introduces 1 high-severity SQL injection risk in user_model.py.
- Overall quality score is low (4.2/10), requires careful review.

Or for a good PR:
- High overall quality (9.1/10) with no critical security issues.
- Implemented requested performance optimizations effectively.
- Code is well-documented and maintainable.

Generate the prSummary in this bulleted TL;DR format.
