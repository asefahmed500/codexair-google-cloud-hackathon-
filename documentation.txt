- **Account Linking:** Users can link multiple OAuth providers (e.g., Google and GitHub) to the same codexair account if the emails match.

### 3.2. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Provides a comprehensive overview of the user's (or platform's for admin) code analysis activities.
- **Analytics Overview:** At-a-glance summary of total analyses, average quality score, critical/high security issues found, and quality score trends.
- **Recent Analyses:** A list of recently analyzed pull requests for quick access.
- **Quality Trends:** A line chart visualizing the average code quality scores over the past 30 days.
- **Top Security Issues:** Lists the most frequently identified security vulnerabilities across analyses.
- **Top Improvement Suggestions:** Highlights common areas for code enhancement.
- **Security Hotspots:** Pinpoints files with recurring critical or high-severity security issues.
- **Contributor Metrics:** Tracks analysis activity and quality scores by contributors (GitHub authors).
- **Connected Repositories:** Shows a list of the user's most recently synced GitHub repositories for quick navigation.
- **GitHub Connection Prompt:** If a user is logged in (e.g., via Google) but hasn't connected their GitHub account, a prompt encourages them to link GitHub to enable full functionality.

### 3.3. Repository Management & Sync (`/analyze`)
- **List Synced Repositories:** Displays repositories the user has connected from GitHub, with server-side pagination and search. Also shows the total open PR count for each repository.
- **Server-Side Search:** Users can search their synced repositories by name, full name, or primary language. The search is performed on the server.
- **Comprehensive Sync:** Allows users to fetch and update their list of repositories from GitHub. This process attempts to retrieve up to 10 pages (approx. 300 repos) of the user's most recently updated repositories from GitHub, stores/updates their metadata in the local database, and also fetches the user's total repository count from GitHub.

### 3.4. Pull Request (PR) Analysis (`/analyze/[owner]/[repoName]`)
- **PR Listing:** View all open and recently closed pull requests for a selected repository, along with their current analysis status (e.g., Not Analyzed, Pending, Analyzed, Failed).
- **AI-Powered PR Analysis Initiation:** Users can initiate an in-depth analysis for any open pull request by clicking "**Analyze with AI**". This process generates vector embeddings for changed/added files, which are stored in the `Analyses` collection for semantic search.
- **Detailed Analysis View (`/analyze/[owner]/[repoName]/[prNumber]/[analysisId]`):**
    - **AI Review Summary (Overall PR):** A concise, AI-generated summary of the key findings for the entire pull request.
    - **Overall Metrics:** Displays aggregated quality score, complexity, and maintainability scores for the PR.
    - **Security Issues Tab:** Lists all identified security vulnerabilities, filterable by severity, with details including file and line numbers.
    - **Suggestions Tab:** Lists all improvement suggestions, filterable by priority, with details including file and line numbers.
    - **File Details Tab:** An accordion view breaking down the analysis file-by-file, showing individual scores, issues/suggestions, and a file-level AI insight.

### 3.5. Full Repository Codebase Analysis
- **Initiation:** From the repository's PR listing page (`/analyze/[owner]/[repoName]`), users can click "**Analyze Codebase with AI**".
- **Scope:** This feature analyzes the current state of the repository's default branch (e.g., `main`, `master`).
    - **Note:** The current version analyzes a limited number of source files (e.g., up to 5) from the default branch to ensure timely results in a synchronous operation. This is clearly communicated to the user on the scan results page.
    - Vector embeddings are generated for analyzed files and stored in the `RepositoryScans` collection for semantic search.
- **Analysis Output (`/analyze/[owner]/[repoName]/scan/[scanId]`):**
    - Provides overall quality, complexity, maintainability scores, lists of security issues and suggestions, and file-by-file breakdowns for the analyzed files.
    - Includes an AI-generated summary for the entire repository scan (based on the analyzed files).
    - Clearly indicates that it's a full repository scan, not tied to a specific PR, and mentions the file analysis limitation.

### 3.6. Semantic Code Search (AI-Powered)
codexair's Semantic Code Search transcends traditional keyword-based searching by understanding the *meaning* behind code and queries. This is achieved through:
- **AI-Driven Embedding Generation (Data Indexing):**
    - During both PR analysis (`/api/analyze`) and full repository scans (`/api/repository-scan`), the content of each analyzed code file is processed by the `googleai/text-embedding-004` AI model.
    - This model converts the code/text into a high-dimensional vector embedding, a numerical fingerprint that captures its semantic essence.
    - These embeddings are stored within the `Analyses` and `RepositoryScans` collections in MongoDB, associated with their respective files.
- **AI-Driven Query Transformation (Search Time):**
    - **General Search (`/search` page):** When a user types a natural language query or pastes a code snippet, this input is sent to the `embedText` Genkit flow. This flow, utilizing the same `text-embedding-004` model, converts the user's query into a vector embedding.
    - **Contextual Search (from analysis/scan pages):** When a user clicks "Find similar past issues/patterns," the system retrieves the pre-computed AI-generated vector embedding for the specific file and issue context from the database.
- **Intelligent Matching (MongoDB Atlas Vector Search):**
    - The query vector (either newly generated or retrieved) is then used to perform a similarity search against the stored embeddings in the `Analyses` and `RepositoryScans` collections using MongoDB Atlas's `$vectorSearch` capabilities.
    - This returns files and their parent PRs/scans that are semantically closest to the user's query, enabling discovery of related solutions, patterns, or previously addressed issues even if the exact wording or syntax differs.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Contextual Search:** From PR analysis or repository scan pages, allows users to find semantically similar occurrences related to a specific issue or suggestion by clicking "**Find similar past issues/patterns**".
    - **General Search Page (`/search`):** A dedicated page for "**Run Semantic Search**" allowing free-form queries (code or natural language) across all indexed PR analyses and repository scans. Results display similar code snippets and their AI-generated insights.

### 3.7. PullRequest Comparison (`/analyze/[owner]/[repoName]/compare/[prNumber1]/vs/[prNumber2]`)
- **Side-by-Side View:** Compares metadata and, if available, full analysis summaries of two pull requests from the same repository.
- **Analysis Initiation:** Option to initiate analysis via "**Analyze PR with AI**" for unanalyzed PRs directly from the comparison view.

### 3.8. "Explain My Code" AI Tool (`/explain`)
- **Input:** Users can paste any code snippet and optionally select the programming language.
- **Interaction:** Choose from predefined questions or ask a custom question.
- **Output:** Provides an AI-generated explanation.

### 3.9. About Page (`/about`)
- Provides information about codexair's mission and vision.
- **Contact Form:** Includes a "Get In Touch" section with a form allowing users to send messages (name, email, message) to the platform administrators. Submitted messages are stored in the database.

## 4. Admin Features

### 4.1. Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **Platform-wide Overview:** Displays statistics like total users, total repositories synced, and total PR analyses.
- **Navigation Cards:** Provides quick navigation to User Management (integrated), Contact Messages, Analysis Reports, and Audit Logs.
- **User Management Section:** Integrated into the main admin page.

### 4.2. User Management (on `/admin` page)
- **View Users:** Lists all registered users with their details.
- **Role Management:** Admins can promote users to 'admin' or demote 'admin' users to 'user'.
- **Status Management:** Admins can change user account status between 'active' and 'suspended'.
- **Safeguards:** Includes checks to prevent accidental lockout of the last admin or last active admin.

### 4.3. Contact Messages (`/admin/messages`)
- **View Messages:** Admins can view messages submitted through the contact form on the About page.
- **Manage Messages:** Messages can be marked as read/unread and deleted.
- **Pagination:** Supports pagination for managing a large number of messages.

### 4.4. Analysis Summary Reports (`/admin/reports`)

## 5. Technical Architecture Overview

### 5.1. Frontend
- **Next.js (App Router), React, ShadCN UI, Tailwind CSS.**
- **Client-Side State Management:** React hooks, `react-hook-form`.

### 5.2. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
- Located in `src/app/api/`.
- Handles:
    - User authentication (`/api/auth/[...nextauth]`).
    - GitHub interactions (`/api/repositories`, `/api/github/repos/...`).
    - Triggering AI analyses (`/api/analyze` for PRs, `/api/repository-scan` for full repo).
    - Fetching analysis results (`/api/analysis-results/[analysisId]`, `/api/repository-scan/[scanId]`).
    - Semantic search operations (`/api/search/semantic-text-search`, `/api/search/similar-code`).
    - Contact form submissions (`/api/contact`).
    - Admin operations (`/api/admin/...`, including `/api/admin/messages`, `/api/admin/messages/[messageId]`).
- The `/api/repositories` route now supports server-side search via a `searchTerm` parameter and displays total open PR counts for repositories.

### 5.3. Database (MongoDB with Mongoose)
- **MongoDB, Mongoose.**
- **Key Collections (Models defined in `src/lib/mongodb.ts`):**
    - `Users`, `Accounts`, `Sessions`, `VerificationTokens`. (User model includes `lastKnownTotalGitHubRepos` and `lastGitHubRepoCountSync`).
    - `Repositories`: Stores metadata for GitHub repositories synced by users.
    - `PullRequests`: Stores details of GitHub pull requests, linking to `Analyses`.
    - `Analyses`: Stores results of PR analyses, including file-level breakdowns and `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`.
    - `RepositoryScans`: Stores results of full repository codebase scans, including `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`.
    - `AuditLogs`: Records administrative actions.
    - `ContactMessages`: Stores messages submitted via the contact form.

## 7. API Workflow Examples (High-Level)

### 7.1. Pull Request Analysis
- User initiates analysis via "**Analyze with AI**".
- Backend (`/api/analyze/route.ts`): Fetches PR details, files from GitHub. Filters files (e.g., up to `MAX_FILES_TO_ANALYZE`). For each selected file:
    - Fetches content (diff or full, truncates if needed for analysis, uses full for embedding).
    - Calls `analyzeCode` Genkit flow for quality, security, suggestions.
    - Generates vector embedding for file content via `ai.embed()` using `text-embedding-004`.
- Aggregates results, calls `summarizePrAnalysis` flow for overall PR summary.
- Saves analysis results to `Analyses` collection (including `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`). Updates `PullRequests` document.

### 7.2. Full Repository Codebase Scan
- User initiates scan via "**Analyze Codebase with AI**".
- Backend (`/api/repository-scan/route.ts`): Determines default branch, fetches file tree. Filters and selects a limited number of source files (up to `MAX_FILES_TO_SCAN`). For each file:
    - Fetches full content (truncates if needed for analysis, uses full for embedding).
    - Calls `analyzeCode` flow.
    - Generates vector embedding for file content via `ai.embed()` using `text-embedding-004`.
- Aggregates results and generates an overall summary by calling `summarizePrAnalysis` flow.
- Saves results to `RepositoryScans` collection (including `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`).

### 7.3. Semantic Search (General Query via `/search` page)
- User submits query on `/search` page.
- Backend (`/api/search/semantic-text-search/route.ts`):
    - Calls `embedText` Genkit flow to generate an embedding for the user's query text using `text-embedding-004`.
    - Calls `findSimilarCode` (from `src/lib/vector-search.ts`).
    - `findSimilarCode` executes two MongoDB Atlas `$vectorSearch` aggregations: one on `analyses` (for PRs) and one on `repositoryscans` (for full scans), comparing the query embedding against stored `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`. Results are combined, sorted by similarity, and limited.
- Returns list of `SimilarCodeResult` objects.

### 7.4. Semantic Search (Contextual from Analysis/Scan Page)
- User clicks "**Find similar past issues/patterns**" on a PR analysis or repository scan page.
- Frontend calls `POST /api/search/similar-code` with `queryAnalysisId` (ID of the current PR Analysis or Repo Scan), `queryFilename`, and `sourceType` ('pr_analysis' or 'repo_scan').
- Backend (`/api/search/similar-code/route.ts`):
    - Fetches the specified `Analysis` or `RepositoryScan` document based on `sourceType`.
    - Extracts the pre-computed `vectorEmbedding` for the `queryFilename` from that document.
    - Calls `findSimilarCode`, passing this embedding, `queryAnalysisId` (for exclusion), and `queryFilename`.
- Returns list of `SimilarCodeResult` objects.

## 8. Security Considerations
- Authentication & Authorization by NextAuth.js.
- Input Validation with Zod schemas.
- GitHub API Access via user-specific tokens.
- Database Security with env-managed URI, Mongoose schemas.
- AI Model Safety (Genkit/Google AI built-in filters).

## 9. Local Setup & Vector Search
- **Environment Variables:** Critical variables must be configured in `.env`.
- **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search Indexes:** For semantic search, **TWO** vector search indexes must be manually configured in MongoDB Atlas:
    1.  **On the `analyses` collection (for PR Analyses):**
        -   **Index Name:** `idx_file_embeddings`
        -   **Field Path:** `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`
        -   **Dimensions:** `768` (matching `text-embedding-004` output)
        -   **Similarity:** `cosine`
    2.  **On the `repositoryscans` collection (for Full Repository Scans):**
        -   **Index Name:** `idx_repo_scan_file_embeddings`
        -   **Field Path:** `fileAnalyses.vectorEmbedding`
        -   **Dimensions:** `768`
        -   **Similarity:** `cosine`
- **Development Servers:** Next.js app (`npm run dev`) and Genkit dev server (`npm run genkit:dev`) must be running.

## 10. Future Enhancements (from README.md)
- CI/CD Integration.
- Asynchronous Full Repository Scans (and analysis of more files).
- Enhanced Semantic Search (more sophisticated queries, filtering).
- Customizable Analysis Rules.
- Team Collaboration Features.
- IDE Integration.
- Expanded Language Support.
